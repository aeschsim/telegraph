# telegraph

The Translator Tool translate a Text written to the console to Morsecode and write it to Console and
in a File <morsecode.txt>. 

This File can be opened with the printer Tool, which controlls two relay, one
for a PEN-UP-and-DOWN and the other for the paper feed.

MAke sure that a File <morsecode.txt> is in the same Directorie like the printer Tool
and that it only contains spaces, "." and "-".

Attention: some parts of this code (Translator) are not written by myself! More infos
you'll find in the Code.
